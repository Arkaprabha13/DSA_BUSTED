## Introduction
In this repository, you'll find implementations of common data structures and algorithms in various programming languages. These implementations are meant for educational purposes and as a reference for DSA concepts.

## Contents
The repository is organized into folders for different categories of DSA, including:
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of classic algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Problem Solving**: Solutions to coding problems from various platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.

Each folder contains code examples, explanations, and sometimes complexity analysis for the algorithms.

## Languages
You'll find implementations in multiple programming languages, including:
- C++
- C
